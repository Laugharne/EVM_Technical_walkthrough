- Before working on RAM **Rust** **EVM**, they were building a **Rust Ethereum client**.

# [01:18](https://youtu.be/Nh19f_2fWLc?t=78) Connecting Abstract Ideas to Code

**Section Overview:** The speaker explains their approach of connecting abstract ideas to code in order to understand what's happening inside the **EVM**.

- By connecting abstract ideas to code, it becomes easier to understand the inner workings of the **EVM**.
- While there is a yellow paper for **EVM**, it can be difficult to read. Many developers rely on code for understanding.
- The **EVM** is a small library with around 4 or 5 thousand lines of code.

# [02:25](https://youtu.be/Nh19f_2fWLc?t=145) Inputs of the **EVM**

**Section Overview:** The speaker discusses the inputs required by the **EVM**, including transactions, blocks, and configurations.

![](02-Block.png)

- The main inputs of the **EVM** are transactions, blocks, and configurations.
- Transactions contain information such as gas limits and account addresses.
- Blocks have additional fields like parent hash and difficulty that are needed for certain opcodes.
- Configurations provide necessary data for executing bytecode from specific accounts.

# [04:15](https://youtu.be/Nh19f_2fWLc?t=255) Database Interface and Input Fetching

**Section Overview:** The speaker explains how database interface works in fetching storage and accounts while executing bytecode in the **EVM**.

![](03-Database-interface.png)

- Database interface dynamically fetches storage and accounts while executing bytecode in the **EVM**.
- When executing bytecode from an account, the **EVM** fetches the account's balance, bytecode hash, and code.
- The simplicity of this interface makes it easy to navigate and reason about.

# [06:20](https://youtu.be/Nh19f_2fWLc?t=380) Inside the **EVM**: Stack-based Machine

# [08:15](https://youtu.be/Nh19f_2fWLc?t=495) Overview of the Interpreter

**Section Overview:** The upper part of the interpreter is the host, while the lower part is the interpreter. The interpreter executes bytecode instructions in a loop, fetching opcodes from memory and executing them. It can also handle sub-calls to other contracts.

## Interpreter Structure

- The interpreter has two stages: pre-compilation and execution.
- Pre-compilation involves analyzing the bytecode to identify jump destinations and ensure correct execution flow.
- Execution occurs in a loop, where each opcode is fetched, executed, and gas calculations are performed.
- The interpreter structure includes elements such as contract, program counter, memory stack, gas calculation, return buffer, and call data.

## Pre-compilation Stage

- Pre-compilation analyzes the bytecode to determine jump destinations for proper execution flow.
- Jump destinations are important for conditional jumps within bytecode instructions.
- Analysis ensures that dynamic jumps do not target data sections of push opcodes.
- This stage can be expensive but is necessary for optimal performance.

## Execution Stage

- Execution involves looping through opcodes and performing their corresponding actions.
- Gas calculations are performed for each opcode based on its complexity or resource usage.
- Host functions may be called during execution for certain opcode operations.
- Memory stack is used to store intermediate values during execution.

# [10:15](https://youtu.be/Nh19f_2fWLc?t=615) Detailed Explanation of Interpreter Functionality

**Section Overview:** This section provides a detailed explanation of how the interpreter works in terms of bytecode analysis and execution stages.

![](06-Interpreter.png)

## Bytecode Analysis

- Bytecode analysis involves examining each instruction in the bytecode from start to end.
- Job destinations are identified to ensure correct jumping within the bytecode.
  - Jumping into data sections of push opcodes must be avoided due to potential ambiguity.

## Expensive First Iteration

- The first iteration of bytecode analysis can be expensive due to the need for thorough examination.
- Pre-calculated bytecode analysis is stored in a database for faster access during execution.
- The pre-calculated bytecode includes jump tables and other relevant information.

## Execution Loop

- The execution loop is responsible for executing each opcode in the bytecode.
- Gas calculations are performed based on opcode complexity or resource usage.
- Host functions may be called during execution to handle specific operations.
- Memory stack is used to store intermediate values during execution.

# [14:26](https://youtu.be/Nh19f_2fWLc?t=866) Structure of the Interpreter

**Section Overview:** This section explains the structure of the interpreter, including its components and their functionalities.

![](07-Interpreter-contains.png)

## Interpreter Components

- Contract: Represents the current contract being executed.
- Program Counter: Points to the next opcode to be executed in memory.
- Memory Stack: Stores intermediate values during execution.
- Gas Calculation: Determines gas usage for each opcode.
- Return Buffer: Stores data returned from sub-calls or callbacks.
  - Used when copying memory back to parent calls after returning from a sub-call.
- Call Data: Contains helper information for inspector purposes.

## Standard Instructions

![](08-Interpreter-machine-in-code.png)

- Memory Load/Store: Instructions for loading/storing data from/to memory.
- Program Counter Jump/Jump Destination Store: Instructions related to program counter manipulation and jumping within bytecode instructions.
  - Jump destinations are determined during pre-compilation stage.

## Environment and Logging

![](09-OpCodes.png)

- Storage Load/Store Environment: Fetches storage or block information as needed by opcodes.
  - Depends on the context of execution (e.g., fetching block timestamp).
- Logging Instructions: Used for logging purposes, including address creation and topics extraction.

![](10-CREATE-And-CREATE2.png)

# [16:05](https://youtu.be/Nh19f_2fWLc?t=965) Address Calculation and Multiple Calls

**Section Overview:** This section discusses how addresses are calculated in relation to multiple calls within the interpreter.

## Address Calculation

- When creating new bytecode, the address calculation is based on the caller's LLP (Last Level Pointer).
- The address calculation does not depend on nodes but rather the salt called.
- This allows for predetermined address calculations even with multiple calls.

## Multiple Calls

![](11-Call-OpCodes.png)

- Multiple calls can occur within the interpreter.
- The specific details of how subsequent calls are made depend on the context and requirements of the execution.

# [16:36](https://youtu.be/Nh19f_2fWLc?t=996) Logging in the Interpreter

**Section Overview:** This section explains logging functionality within the interpreter.

## Logging Details

![](12-Logs.png)

- Logs contain information such as creator addresses and topics.
- Creator addresses indicate who created a particular log entry.
- Topics are extracted from stack values or memory during execution.

# [17:25](https://youtu.be/Nh19f_2fWLc?t=1045) Gas Price Mechanism in **EVM**S

**Section Overview:** This section discusses the gas price mechanism used in Ethereum Virtual Machines (**EVM**s).

## Gas Price Calculation

![](13-Gas.png)

- The gas price in **EVM**s is determined by multiplying the gas used by the gas price.
- The gas price can vary depending on factors such as the original gas price and other calculations.
- The caller of a transaction is responsible for paying the calculated gas price.

## Base Fee and Priority Fee

- Every transaction needs to pay a base fee, which is a fixed fee set by the network.
- Additionally, there can be an optional priority fee that the caller can choose to pay.
- The final gas price is calculated by adding the base fee and multiplying it with the priority fee.

## Gas Strip Funds

- There was an idea called "gas strip funds" where users would receive some of their spent gas back if they reduced state in some way.
- However, this idea was not widely adopted or implemented due to complexity and usability concerns. [17:41](https://youtu.be/Nh19f_2fWLc?t=1061)
